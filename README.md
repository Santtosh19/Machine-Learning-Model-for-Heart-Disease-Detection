# Machine-Learning-Model-for-Heart-Disease-Detection
This project focuses on building and evaluating machine learning models to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on various health metrics. The models were developed using three machine learning algorithms: Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM).
