# Machine-Learning-Model-for-Heart-Disease-Detection
This project focuses on building and evaluating machine learning models to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on various health metrics. The models were developed using three machine learning algorithms: Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The goal is to identify the most effective model for heart disease detection, particularly in environments with limited medical resources.


**How to Run:
Requirements:

~Python 3.x installed on your computer.

~Required libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn


***Running the Notebook:

Download the Assignment 2.ipynb file.
Open the Jupyter Notebook environment.
Navigate to the directory where the notebook is located.
Run the notebook cells sequentially to preprocess the data, train the models, and evaluate their performance.


***Dataset:

The dataset used is heart_disease.csv, which contains various health-related features used to predict heart disease.


***Steps to Build and Evaluate Models:

1.Data Preparation: Load and clean the dataset, handle missing and duplicate data, and select relevant features.

2 Model Training: Split the dataset into training and testing sets, and train the Naive Bayes, KNN, and SVM models.
3. Model Evaluation: Calculate accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and check for overfitting for each model.
4. Comparison and Recommendation: Compare the performance of the models and recommend the best one for heart disease prediction.


***Code Structure:

Data Preparation: Loading and cleaning the dataset, feature selection, data splitting, and standardization.

Model Building: Training Naive Bayes, KNN, and SVM models.

Model Evaluation: Evaluating the models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and checking for overfitting.

Comparison: Comparing the performance of the models and recommending the best model.
